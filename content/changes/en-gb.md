Last month, we announced the [upcoming repository redirect behavior for the API] [original announcement] , and we made it available for developers to preview. Starting **July 21, 2015**, the API will automatically provide these redirects for all API consumers.

To learn more about repository redirects and how they will benefit your applications, be sure to check out the [original announcement] [] .

To start enjoying repository redirects right away, just provide the following custom [media type] [] in the `Accept` header:

Thanks to everyone that tried out this enhancement during the preview period.

As always, if you have any questions, please [get in touch] [contact] . We love hearing from you.
